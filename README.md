# Neural Style Transfer Web App

This project is a **full-stack web application** for applying artistic style transfer to images.  
Users can upload a **content image** and a **style image**, and the backend will generate a new image with the style applied to the content.

## ðŸ“œ Project Journey

Initially, I implemented **Neural Style Transfer** using the **VGG-19 optimization-based approach**.  
While this method is academically popular and produces high-quality results in research settings, in practice it had two major drawbacks:

1. **Extremely Slow Output Generation**  
   - Required running optimization for multiple epochs and steps per epoch.  
   - Even with reduced parameters (e.g., 5 epochs, 50 steps per epoch), output time was still high (tens of seconds to minutes per image).  

2. **Poor Visual Results for Quick Runs**  
   - Reducing training time to speed up the process caused noisy and heavily distorted outputs.  

Because of this, I decided to switch to a **Feed-Forward Pre-Trained Model**.

## ðŸš€ Feed-Forward Model Approach

The new implementation uses a **pre-trained TensorFlow Hub model**:

- Model: [`magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256`](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2)
- Advantage:
  - **Real-time inference** (1â€“2 seconds per image on CPU, faster on GPU)
  - No need for iterative optimization
  - Consistently produces better and cleaner results compared to quick VGG runs

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React (with Tailwind CSS for styling)
- Simple file upload UI for content & style images

**Backend**
- Flask (Python)
- TensorFlow + TensorFlow Hub
- Pillow for image handling

## âš¡ Running the Project

1. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   
3. **Usage**

- Open the frontend in your browser.
- Upload a content image and a style image.
- Wait for processing (~1â€“2 seconds).
- Download the styled output.
